# DevRelConSF19

We all work really hard writing documentation and tutorials to explain how our products work. But are we taking a 'one-size-fits-all' approach that creates more confusion than it should?

In this talk Amara will outline the steps she took for developing more inclusive content for the game dev community, while also covering there areas where she feels she still needs to improve.

Youâ€™ll walk away ready to evaluate your developer content with some though provoking questions to get you and your team started.

## Things to Think About

Who is using your docs today? Are they getting what they need?

Are you agile? Consider adjusting your personas too.

Did you cover the basics? Are you sure?

Did you make assumptions that could alienate groups?
